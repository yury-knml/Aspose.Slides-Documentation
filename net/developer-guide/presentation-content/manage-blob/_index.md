## **Export Blob from Presentation**
Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a facility to Export large files (audio and video file in that case). We want to extract these files from the presentation and do not want to load this presentation into memory to keep our memory consumption low. Here is an example is given below how we can export blob from presentations.

## **Add Image as BLOB in Presentation**
Aspose.Slides for .NET added a new method to [**IImageCollection**](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides/iimagecollection) interface and [**ImageCollection** ](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides/imagecollection)class to support adding a large image as streams to treat them as BLOBs.

This example demonstrates how to include the large BLOB (image) and prevent high memory consumption.
