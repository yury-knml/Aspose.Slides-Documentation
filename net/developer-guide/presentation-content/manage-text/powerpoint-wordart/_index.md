 [**IInnerShadow**](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides.effects/iinnershadow) classes 
 in order to apply shadow effects on the text carried by TextFrame. These classes are available in the [**Aspose.Slides.Effects**](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides.effects/) namespace and provides a number of properties for handling the shadow effects.
